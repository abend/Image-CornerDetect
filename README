NAME
    Image::CornerDetect - An implementation of the Xiaochen He corner
    detection algorithm.

SYNOPSIS
      use Image::CornerDetect;
      my $detector = Image::CornerDetect->new();
      my @corners = $detector->process($filename);

DESCRIPTION
    Perform corner detection on an input image, returning a list of corner
    points.

USAGE
      use Image::CornerDetect;
      my $detector = Image::CornerDetect->new();
      my @corners = $detector->process($filename);
